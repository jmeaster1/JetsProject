Jets

Application Overview

This application creates a fleet of jets!..in code...this application will be a menu to access information about your jets.


Structure

Jets must have a model, speed, range, and capacity associated with them. The speed should be taken in MPH but displayed to the user in Mach.


User Story #1

There is a menu with 5 options:

List fleet
View fastest jet
View jet with longest range
Add a jet to Fleet
Quit
User Story #2

List fleet prints out the model, speed, range, and capacity of each jet. (There must be at least 5 jets stored when the program starts).

User Story #3

The view fastest jet and longest range options both print out all of the information about their jets.

User Story #4

Quit exits the program.

User Story #5

A user can add custom jets to the fleet.

**Stretch Goals**

User Story #6

Each jet has a pilot

User Story #7

Assign a random pilot to each jet that is created

User Story #8

Users can hire pilots

User Story #9

Whenever a jet's information is displayed, that jet's pilot and his/her information should also be displayed

**Test Conditions:**

When menu option 1 is pressed all Jets in the fleet are displayed to the user.
When menu option 2 is selected, the fastest jet from the list of Jets should be displayed to the user.
When menu option 3 is selected, the jet with the longest range should be displayed to the user.
When option 4 is pressed you should be prompted to enter the model, speed (in MPH), range, and price. This Jet should be added to the list of Jets so that when the user again selects menu option 1, that custom jet is included.

 When option 5 is pressed you should be prompted to enter the name, age, and experience of a custom pilot. This pilot should be added to the barracks.

Option 6 should exit the program.
